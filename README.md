# Song of the Day

This is a Codecademy Group project named Mixed Messages in the Full-Stack Engineer Career Path.

## Prompt

For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

## Steps

1. Plan your project
    + I'll have a list of over 100 different songs.
    + Each time the program is run, a new song will be offered to the user.

2. Come Up with a Topic
    + The program will output a song title and artist, and a link to a youtube search with that information.
    + These songs can be found in songs.csv

3. Create script and run it locally
    + Script will be called main.js.

4. Set up version control
    + A git repository has been made and put on github.
